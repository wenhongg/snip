## Vision

Snip is a **menu-bar-only** macOS screenshot tool that makes capturing, annotating, and finding screenshots effortless. Every screenshot is automatically analyzed by AI, given a descriptive name, sorted into categories, and made searchable via natural language.

The app should feel **invisible until needed** — a global shortcut captures, a quick annotation pass adds context, and the screenshot is instantly on your clipboard and organized for later.

---

## Target User

Power users on macOS who take 5-50 screenshots per day: developers, designers, PMs, support engineers. They paste screenshots into Slack, Jira, Notion, and docs constantly. They never find old screenshots because they're buried in `~/Desktop` with timestamps as names.

---

## Core Value Props

1. **Fastest capture-to-clipboard** — Two keystrokes: Cmd+Shift+2 to capture, Esc to copy annotated image to clipboard. Under 5 seconds.
2. **Smart organization** — AI names, categorizes, and tags every saved screenshot. No manual filing.
3. **Semantic search** — Find any screenshot by describing what was in it. "slack message about deployment" finds the right one.
4. **Native feel** — Liquid Glass UI, tray-only app, no Dock icon, works across macOS Spaces without switching.

---

## Feature Set

### Capture
- **Global shortcut** (Cmd+Shift+2): Fullscreen overlay, drag to select region, Enter to crop
- **Full-screen capture**: Press Enter without dragging
- Works across macOS Spaces without switching desktops
- Home window hides during capture to stay out of the way

### Annotation Tools
| Tool | Key | Description |
|------|-----|-------------|
| Select | V | Move, resize, delete annotations |
| Rectangle | R | Outline, highlight, or blur modes |
| Text | T | Editable text with font/size pickers |
| Arrow | A | Point at things |
| Tag | G | Two-click callout: draggable label group + draggable anchor tip with leader line |
| Blur Brush | B | Paint to pixelate sensitive info |
| Segment | S | AI-powered object selection (SlimSAM) — Apply Cutout or Tag Segment (4-color palette: Red/Yellow/Green/Blue) |
| Animate | — | Animate a segment cutout into GIF/APNG via fal.ai cloud API |

### Save & Export
- **Esc/Enter/Done**: Copy annotated PNG to clipboard, close editor
- **Cmd+S/Save**: Save JPEG to disk + copy PNG to clipboard + queue for AI

### AI Organization
- Local vision LLM (via Ollama) analyzes each saved screenshot — runs entirely on-device
- Returns: category, descriptive name, tags, description
- File renamed and moved to category subfolder
- 384-dim embedding generated for semantic search (HuggingFace Transformers.js, also local)
- New category suggestions via macOS notification
- Default model: `minicpm-v` (8B, Metal-accelerated on Apple Silicon) — pulled on first launch via Ollama's API. Ollama is not bundled; users install it separately or via the in-app setup wizard.

### Animation (Animate)
- Requires internet connection and a fal.ai API key (configured in Settings > Animation)
- Uses fal.ai Wan 2.2 image-to-video cloud API with text-based animation prompts
- AI-generated presets: Ollama (minicpm-v) analyzes the cutout and suggests 3 animation motions tailored to the subject (e.g., "wag tail" for a dog, "sway in wind" for a plant). Falls back to 6 static presets (Breathe, Sway, Bounce, Wobble, Float, Zoom In) if Ollama is unavailable.
- Custom prompt mode: users can type their own animation description instead of picking a preset
- All animations capped at 4 seconds maximum
- Generates at 480p resolution, costs approximately $0.08-0.15 per animation
- Pipeline: composite cutout onto magenta background → upload to fal.ai → submit job to queue → poll for result → download MP4 → extract frames via ffmpeg → chroma-key magenta out per-frame → encode as GIF + APNG
- Output formats: GIF (256 colors, 1-bit transparency) and APNG (full color, 8-bit alpha)
- Result panel keyboard shortcuts: Enter or Cmd+S saves GIF, R redoes with another preset, Esc discards
- Animations saved to `~/Documents/snip/screenshots/animations/` (not processed by AI organizer)

### Search
- **Cmd+Shift+F**: Semantic search using local embeddings (no API calls)
- Falls back to text matching without embeddings
- Tag cloud for quick filtering

### Gallery
- Browse screenshots by category folders
- Thumbnails with hover-to-delete
- Click to reveal in Finder

### Settings
- AI Assistant status and model info
- Animation settings: fal.ai API key input, info panel (provider, resolution, max duration, output formats, save location, AI preset status)
- Three themes: Dark, Light, Glass
- Custom category management
- Full keyboard shortcuts reference table

### Tray Menu
- Capture, Search, Show Snip, Theme submenu, Quit

## Terminology

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **Snip** | A screenshot (never say "screenshot" in the UI) |
| **Snip It** | The capture action (menu item and tray label) |
| **Category** | AI-assigned folder: code, chat, web, design, documents, terminal, personal, fun, other |
| **Tag** | AI-assigned keyword for search/filtering |
| **Glass** | The translucent Liquid Glass theme on macOS 26+ |

---

## Product Principles

1. **Clipboard-first**: Most users want the screenshot on their clipboard immediately. Saving to disk is secondary.
2. **Zero-config by default**: In-app setup wizard guides Ollama install and model download on first launch. Works without AI if user skips setup.
3. **Non-intrusive**: Tray-only, no Dock icon, no Space switching, hides during capture.
4. **AI is invisible labor**: Users don't "invoke AI" — it just happens in the background after save.
5. **Purple, always purple**: The brand color is violet/purple. Never blue. See [`DESIGN.md`](DESIGN.md).

## Future Considerations

- OCR / text extraction from screenshots
- Screenshot history timeline
- Team sharing / cloud sync
- Custom shortcut configuration
