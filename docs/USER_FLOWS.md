# User Flows

> Role: **QA / Product Manager** — Step-by-step user flows with preconditions, expected behavior, and edge cases. Use as acceptance criteria and test case definitions.

Detailed user flows for every feature in Snip. Each flow describes preconditions, steps, expected behavior, and edge cases. Designed to be converted directly into automated and manual test cases.

---

## 1. App Lifecycle

### 1.1 First Launch

**Preconditions:** Fresh install, no config file, no screenshots directory.

| Step | Action | Expected Result |
|------|--------|-----------------|
| 1 | Run `npm start` | App starts, tray icon appears in menu bar |
| 2 | -- | No Dock icon visible (`app.dock.hide()` in dev, `LSUIElement: true` in production) |
| 3 | -- | `~/Documents/snip/screenshots/` directory created automatically |
| 4 | -- | Config file created at `~/Library/Application Support/snip/snip-config.json` with default categories |
| 5 | -- | Home window opens with Gallery page showing "No screenshots yet" empty state |
| 6 | -- | SAM segmentation model begins loading in background (logged: `[Segmentation Worker] Loading SlimSAM model...`) |
| 7 | -- | File watcher starts monitoring screenshots directory (logged: `[Organizer] Watching: ...`) |
| 8 | -- | Ollama detection runs: checks `127.0.0.1:11434` for running server, then checks known install paths |
| 8a | -- | If Ollama running: connects immediately (logged: `[Ollama] Server already running`) |
| 8b | -- | If Ollama installed but not running: auto-starts via `open -a Ollama` or `ollama serve` |
| 8c | -- | If Ollama not installed: Settings shows "Setting Up Your AI Assistant" with Install button |
| 9 | -- | If connected and minicpm-v model found: status shows "Running" immediately |
| 9a | -- | If connected but model missing: Settings shows "Download Model" button (~5 GB) |

### 1.2 Native Glass Layer Initialization

**Preconditions:** macOS 26+ (Tahoe), `electron-liquid-glass` native addon built.

| Step | Action | Expected Result |
|------|--------|-----------------|
| 1 | App starts | `electron-liquid-glass` module loaded, `isGlassSupported()` and `_addon` checked |
| 2 | -- | If both pass: native glass path used (no `vibrancy` set on windows) |
| 3 | -- | If either fails: `vibrancy: 'under-window'` set on home/editor windows |
| 4 | Home window's `did-finish-load` fires | `liquidGlass.addView()` called with native window handle |
| 5 | -- | If `addView` returns valid ID (>= 0): native glass layer active behind web content |
| 6 | -- | Glass layer is always present; the Glass theme's CSS reveals it via transparent backgrounds |
| 7 | -- | If `addView` fails (returns < 0): `setVibrancy('under-window')` applied as fallback |

**Fallback chain:**
1. Native Liquid Glass (`NSGlassEffectView` via `electron-liquid-glass`)
2. Electron vibrancy (`vibrancy: 'under-window'`)
3. CSS `backdrop-filter: blur()` with translucent backgrounds
4. Solid opaque backgrounds (when `backdrop-filter` unsupported)

### 1.3 Single Instance Lock

| Step | Action | Expected Result |
|------|--------|-----------------|
| 1 | App is already running | -- |
| 2 | Run `npm start` again | Second instance quits immediately |
| 3 | -- | First instance's home window shows and focuses |

### 1.4 Window-All-Closed Behavior

| Step | Action | Expected Result |
|------|--------|-----------------|
| 1 | Close the home window (red traffic light) | Window closes but app keeps running (tray icon remains) |
| 2 | Click tray icon > "Show Snip" | Home window reopens |

---

## 2. Screenshot Capture

### 2.1 Full Capture Flow (Happy Path)

**Preconditions:** App running, Screen Recording permission granted.

| Step | Action | Expected Result |
|------|--------|-----------------|
| 1 | Press Cmd+Shift+2 | Home window hides |
| 2 | -- | Display under the cursor is captured via `desktopCapturer.getSources()` |
| 3 | -- | Fullscreen transparent overlay appears on that display |
| 4 | -- | Overlay covers entire display including menu bar |
| 5 | -- | Cursor becomes crosshair, hint text visible: "Drag to select a region, then press Enter" |
| 6 | Drag to select a rectangular region | Selection box appears with handles |
| 7 | (Optional) Drag inside selection to reposition | Selection moves without resizing |
| 8 | Press Enter | Overlay closes, editor window opens with cropped image |
| 9 | -- | Editor window is centered on screen, min width 900px |
| 10 | -- | Toolbar visible at top with all tools |

### 2.2 Full-Screen Capture (No Selection)

| Step | Action | Expected Result |
|------|--------|-----------------|
| 1 | Press Cmd+Shift+2 | Overlay appears |
| 2 | Press Enter immediately (no drag) | Editor opens with full-screen capture |

### 2.3 Cancel Capture

| Step | Action | Expected Result |
|------|--------|-----------------|
| 1 | Press Cmd+Shift+2 | Overlay appears |
| 2 | Press Escape | Overlay closes, home window re-shows |

### 2.4 Capture While Editor Is Open

| Step | Action | Expected Result |
|------|--------|-----------------|
| 1 | Editor window is open from a previous capture | -- |
| 2 | Press Cmd+Shift+2 | Editor window focuses (no new capture started) |

### 2.5 macOS Space Switching (Regression Test)

**Preconditions:** App's home window is on Space 1. User is on Space 2.

| Step | Action | Expected Result |
|------|--------|-----------------|
| 1 | Switch to Space 2 (different from app's Space) | -- |
| 2 | Press Cmd+Shift+2 | Overlay appears on Space 2 (current viewport) |
| 3 | -- | macOS does NOT switch to Space 1 |
| 4 | -- | Home window is hidden, not visible on any Space |

**Key implementation details:**
- `app.dock.hide()` prevents Dock-based Space switching
- `LSUIElement: true` in production achieves the same
- Native module sets `NSWindowCollectionBehaviorMoveToActiveSpace` on overlay
- `homeWindow.hide()` called before capture

### 2.6 No Screen Recording Permission

| Step | Action | Expected Result |
|------|--------|-----------------|
| 1 | Revoke Screen Recording permission for the app | -- |
| 2 | Press Cmd+Shift+2 | Permission pre-check detects `denied` status |
| 3 | -- | Dialog appears: "Snip needs Screen Recording permission to capture snips." |
| 4 | -- | Dialog buttons: "Open System Settings" and "Cancel" |
| 5 | Click "Open System Settings" | macOS System Settings opens to Privacy > Screen Recording |
| 6 | -- | Home window does NOT re-show (permission errors skip home window restore) |

**Edge cases:**
- First launch (`not-determined` status): capture proceeds, macOS shows its native permission prompt
- Blank thumbnails (macOS 15+): secondary check detects blank capture and shows the same dialog
- After granting permission: user must restart Snip for the change to take effect

---

## 3. Annotation Editor

### 3.1 Rectangle Tool

| Step | Action | Expected Result |
|------|--------|-----------------|

**Rectangle Modes:**

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| Outline | Solid stroke, transparent fill |
| Highlight | Semi-transparent colored fill, no stroke |
| Blur | Pixelated/mosaic effect inside rectangle |

**Edge cases:**
- Switching mode while a rectangle is selected updates that rectangle's mode
- Very small drags (< 5px) should still create a visible rectangle

### 3.2 Text Tool

| Step | Action | Expected Result |
|------|--------|-----------------|
| 1 | Press T | Text tool active |
| 2 | Click on canvas | Editable text box created at click position |
| 3 | Type text | Text appears in active color, selected font and size (default 16px) |

| 5 | -- | Ghost bubble rectangle follows cursor |
| 6 | Move mouse away from tip | Preview line and bubble update in real-time |
| 7 | Click on canvas (second click) | Final tag created: tip dot + leader line + text bubble |
| 8 | -- | Text editing mode entered immediately with "Label" selected |
| 9 | Type label text | Text appears in bubble, bubble auto-sizes on editing exit |
| 10 | Press Enter | Text editing exits; switches to Select (cursor) mode with label selected |
| 11 | Press Shift+Enter | Inserts a newline in the tag label |
| 12 | Click outside or press Escape | Also exits editing and creates the tag |

**Draggable tag labels:**

| Step | Action | Expected Result |
|------|--------|-----------------|
| 1 | Select a tag's label group | Label (bubble + text) selected, tip dot stays fixed |
| 2 | Drag the label | Bubble moves freely; leader line stretches from tip to label edge |
| 3 | Click the tip anchor | Tip circle selected with color-matched border outline |
| 4 | Drag the tip anchor | Tip moves freely; leader line stretches from tip to label edge |
| 5 | Release | Line connects tip to nearest edge of label bubble |

**Click-to-edit (in Select mode):**

| Step | Action | Expected Result |
|------|--------|-----------------|
| 1 | Switch to Select tool (V) | -- |
| 2 | Click an existing tag | First click: selects the label; toolbar shows tag color swatches + font controls |
| 3 | Click the selected tag again | Label ungroups, text enters editing mode; tag color swatches remain visible |
| 4 | Edit the text | Bubble auto-resizes as user types |
| 5 | Change tag color (via swatch) while editing | Bubble, tip, line, and overlay (if segment tag) update in real-time |
| 6 | Press Enter | Label re-groups with updated text; switches to Select (cursor) mode |
| 7 | Press Shift+Enter | Inserts newline in label text |
| 8 | Double-click an existing tag | Also enters editing mode (shortcut for steps 2-3) |

**Edge cases:**
- Second click too close to first (< 20px): placement cancelled, returns to idle
- Press Escape during placement (after first click): preview objects removed, returns to idle
- Switching tools mid-placement: preview objects cleaned up automatically
- Undo (Cmd+Z) removes the entire tag (label group + linked tip + line) in one step
- Redo (Cmd+Shift+Z) restores the tag with all linked parts
- Color/font/size changes apply to selected label group and linked parts (tip, line); bubble auto-resizes on font/size change
- Delete/Backspace removes the label group and all linked parts

| 8 | Press Escape / Cancel | Mask discarded |

**Tag Segment overlay:**
- **Highlight (T):** Translucent color fill + outline ring over the mask area (35% opacity, 10px outline via dilation)
- **Segment color palette** is limited to 4 colors: Red (#EF4444), Yellow (#EAB308), Green (#22C55E), Blue (#3B82F6) — separate from the regular tag palette
- Attaches a tag bubble (tip + leader line + label) at the center of the mask
- Label group (bubble + text) and tip anchor are both independently draggable with dynamic leader line
- Double-click the label group to re-edit the label text
- After completing cutout or tagging, editor switches to Select (cursor) mode

**Editing segment tags after creation:**

**Edge cases:**
- Segment tool hidden if `checkSegmentSupport()` returns false (< 4GB RAM or no system Node)
- Image resized to max 1024px before sending to SAM
- BGRA to RGBA conversion handled for Electron's native image format

### 3.7 2GIF Animation (After Segment)

**Preconditions:** Segment tool used, cutout accepted (Apply Cutout). Internet connection available. fal.ai API key must be configured in Settings > Animation.

| Step | Action | Expected Result |
|------|--------|-----------------|
| 1 | Accept a segment cutout (Enter / Apply Cutout) | Cutout applied to canvas background |
| 2 | -- | Purple "2GIF" button appears at bottom center |
| 3 | Click "2GIF" button | Preset picker panel appears with "✨ Generating presets" loading state while Ollama analyzes cutout |
| 3a | -- | After ~3-5 seconds: loading replaced with 3 AI-tailored animation presets + "✨ AI" badge on title |
| 3b | -- | If Ollama unavailable: 6 static presets shown instead (no badge), seamless fallback |
| 4 | -- | Presets shown as a single-column list (label + description per row) |
| 4a | -- | Below presets: divider with "or describe your own" text, text input + go button |
| 5a | Click a preset | Panel closes, progress overlay appears with spark animations |
| 5b | Type custom prompt + click go / press Enter | Panel closes, progress overlay appears (uses `_custom` preset name) |
| 6 | -- | Progress: "Uploading image..." (5%) |
| 7 | -- | Progress: "Starting generation..." (10%) |
| 8 | -- | Progress: "In queue (position N)..." (10-15%) |
| 9 | -- | Progress: "Generating..." (15-90%, polled every 1s from fal.ai queue API) |
| 10 | -- | Progress: "Downloading video..." (92%) |
| 11 | -- | Progress: "Encoding GIF..." / "Encoding frame X/N..." (95-100%) |
| 12 | Generation complete | Result panel appears with animated GIF preview |
| 13 | -- | Buttons: "Save GIF", "Save APNG", "Redo", "Discard" |
| 14 | -- | Keyboard: Enter or Cmd+S saves GIF, R redoes, Esc discards |
| 15 | Click "Save GIF" (or Enter / Cmd+S) | GIF saved to `~/Documents/snip/screenshots/animations/<timestamp>.gif` |
| 16 | Click "Save APNG" | APNG saved as `~/Documents/snip/screenshots/animations/<timestamp>.png` |
| 17 | Click "Redo" (or R) | Result panel closes, preset picker reopens for another generation |
| 18 | Click "Discard" (or Esc) | Result panel closes, animation discarded |

**Pipeline detail:**
1. Cutout PNG composited onto magenta (#FF00FF) background — prevents fal.ai from hallucinating scenery (magenta chosen over green so green subjects aren't keyed out)
2. Composited PNG uploaded to fal.ai storage (pre-signed URL)
3. Job submitted to `fal-ai/wan/v2.2-a14b/image-to-video` queue API with text prompt (from preset or custom user input)
4. Queue polled every 1 second until COMPLETED or FAILED (2-minute timeout)
5. Resulting MP4 video downloaded (capped at 4 seconds max)
6. `ffmpeg-static` extracts raw RGBA frames in `gif-encoder-worker.js` child process
7. Per-frame chroma-key removes magenta pixels → transparent (tracks subject movement dynamically)
8. Frames encoded as GIF + APNG

**AI-generated presets:**
- When user clicks 2GIF, cutout image sent to Ollama (minicpm-v) for analysis
- Ollama returns 3 animation suggestions tailored to the subject (e.g., "wag tail" for a dog)
- AI presets use `_custom` preset name internally, passing the AI prompt via `options.customPrompt`
- "✨ AI" badge shown on panel title when AI presets are active
- Falls back to 6 static presets (inlined in `animation.js`) if Ollama is not running or fails
- "✨ Generating presets" loading text shown while waiting for Ollama (~3-5 seconds)
- **Preset caching**: presets are cached within the same cutout session. Clicking "Redo" reuses cached presets instantly without re-calling Ollama. Cache clears when a new cutout is created.

**Custom prompt:**
- User types a free-form animation description (e.g., "gently swaying in the wind")
- Input limited to 200 characters, submitted with Enter key or arrow button
- Uses preset name `_custom` with `options.customPrompt` containing the text
- `num_frames` capped at `fps × 4` (max 65) to enforce 4-second limit
- Empty prompts show toast: "Enter a prompt describing the animation"

**GIF vs APNG:**
- GIF: 256 colors, 1-bit transparency (may have jagged edges on cutout boundary)
- APNG: full 24-bit color, 8-bit alpha (smooth transparent edges, larger file)

**Edge cases:**
- 2GIF button only appears after accepting a segment cutout, not during any other tool use
- 2GIF button only appears when fal.ai API key is configured (checked via `checkAnimateSupport()`)
- Cancel in preset picker returns to showing the 2GIF button
- `checkAnimateSupport()` returns `{ supported: true }` only if a fal.ai API key is stored in config
- Animation times out after 2 minutes of polling with an error message
- Transient API errors during polling are retried automatically
- All animations (preset or custom) capped at 4 seconds maximum
- Result panel: Enter or Cmd+S saves GIF, R redoes, Esc discards
- Animations saved to `animations/` subdirectory, not processed by the AI organizer (watcher has `depth: 0`, skips subdirectories; also only watches `.jpg`/`.jpeg`/`.png` extensions)

## 8. Settings

### 8.1 Setting Up Your AI Assistant (Inline Overlay)

The setup wizard appears as a **full-window inline overlay** inside the home window (not a separate popup). It auto-shows on first launch if Ollama is not fully ready, and can be reopened from the Settings "Set up" button.

**Overlay structure:** Three views — Steps (install/running/model), Welcome, Failed. Only one visible at a time. Step cards show numbered indicators (pending → active → done with checkmark).

## 12. Edge Cases and Error Handling

### 12.1 No Screenshots Directory

| Condition | Expected Behavior |
|-----------|-------------------|
| `~/Documents/snip/screenshots/` doesn't exist | Created by `initStore()` with `mkdirSync({ recursive: true })` |

### 12.2 Corrupt Index File

| Condition | Expected Behavior |
|-----------|-------------------|
| `.index.json` is invalid JSON | `loadIndex()` catches parse error, returns empty array |

### 12.3 Native Module Not Built

| Condition | Expected Behavior |
|-----------|-------------------|
| `build/Release/window_utils.node` missing (dev) | Warning logged, capture still works but overlay may appear on wrong Space |
| `Resources/native/window_utils.node` missing (packaged) | Same behavior — addon loaded from `extraResources` path in packaged app, `build/Release/` path in dev |

### 12.4 SAM Model Not Available

| Condition | Expected Behavior |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Less than 4GB RAM or no system Node.js | `checkSegmentSupport()` returns `{ supported: false }` |
| -- | Segment tool hidden from toolbar |

### 12.5 Large Image Capture

| Condition | Expected Behavior |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Full Retina screen capture (e.g. 3456x2234 physical pixels) | Editor window capped at 90% of screen width/height |
| -- | Canvas uses CSS dimensions, not physical pixels |

### 12.6 Concurrent Captures

|-----------|-------------------|
| Press Cmd+Shift+2 while overlay is already showing | No action (overlay already visible) |
| Press Cmd+Shift+2 while editor is open | Editor window focuses, no new capture |

---

## 13. Build & Distribution

### 13.1 Local Build (Unsigned / Ad-Hoc)

| Step | Action | Expected Result |
|------|--------|-----------------|
| 1 | Run `npm run build` | `node-gyp rebuild` compiles `window_utils.node` |
| 2 | -- | `electron-builder --mac` packages the app |
| 3 | -- | `afterPack` hook removes unused native modules (canvas, sharp) and non-macOS onnxruntime binaries |
| 4 | -- | No `CSC_LINK` detected — `sign:adhoc` runs `codesign --force --deep --sign -` |
| 5 | -- | DMG output in `dist/` (ad-hoc signed, not notarized) |

### 13.2 Signed + Notarized Build

**Preconditions:** `.env` file with `CSC_LINK` (base64 .p12 of "Developer ID Application" cert), `CSC_KEY_PASSWORD`, `APPLE_ID`, `APPLE_ID_PASSWORD`, `APPLE_TEAM_ID`.

| Step | Action | Expected Result |
|------|--------|-----------------|
| 1 | Run `./scripts/build-signed.sh` | Credentials loaded from `.env` |
| 2 | -- | Certificate validated — must be "Developer ID Application" |
| 3 | -- | `npm run prebuild` compiles native addon |
| 4 | -- | `electron-builder --mac` assembles app directory |
| 5 | -- | `afterPack` hook runs: removes canvas/sharp/@img, strips non-macOS onnxruntime binaries, pre-signs remaining `.node`/`.dylib` files |
| 6 | -- | electron-builder signs the full app bundle with Developer ID cert |
| 7 | -- | App submitted to Apple notary service, stapled on success |
| 8 | -- | Signed + notarized DMG output in `dist/` |

**Edge cases:**

| Condition | Expected Behavior |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Wrong cert type (Apple Development) | Build script exits early with clear error message |
| Missing env vars | Build script exits early listing missing vars |
| Notarization rejected | electron-builder shows Apple's error log with specific binary paths |
